Calculator
    First attempt is a very basic calculator and probably a bunch of spaghetti code. I'm going t work on having a separate
    calculator       
    class and GUI, then add other calculator functions.
    
    Second attempt at a calculator involves a separate Calculator class which is pretty lame.
    
    Third attempt, using Kivy for the GUI instead of pygame has a much improved Calculator class which can 
    handle parenthesis although the GUI does not allow for their input. The GUI is basic as hell but and I
    want to work on other things so it can wait. The Calculator class works just fine though.
    
    Fourth attempt, the gui extends the kivy gui from the thrid one and allows for inputing parentheses, powers of numbers 0-9 and
    backspacing. The next steps will be to improve the look of the gui and rethink the calculator class. I'm thinking it would make
    more sense to input a list rather tan a string. 
    

Fractionator.Fraction(frac,unit=0) calculator class object.
    'frac' takes a tuple argument (num,denom). 
    My debugged and upgraded version of the example class given in MIT's lecture on OOP published on youtube. 
    I added multiplication and division as well as ironing out the bugs in the other functions.
