Calculator
  First attempt is a very basic calculator and probably a bunch of spaghetti code. I'm going to work on having a separate calculator class and GUI, then add other calculator functions.
  Calculato_1 is the polished version. It has 10 more lines of code but the functionality is better and the code i a little neater. Next step is to allow for the handling of longer equations including parentheses, then more math functions.
  

Fractionator.Fraction(frac,unit=0) calculator class object.
  'frac' takes a tuple argument (num,denom). 
  My debugged and upgraded version of the example class given in MIT's lecture on OOP published on youtube. 
  I added multiplication and division as well as ironing out the bugs in the other functions.
