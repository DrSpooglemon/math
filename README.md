Calculator
    First attempt is a very basic calculator and probably a bunch of spaghetti code. I'm going t work on having a separate calculator       
    class and GUI, then add other calculator functions.
    
    Second attempt at a calculator involves a separate Calculator class which is pretty lame.
    
    Third attempt, using Kivy for the GUI instead of pygame has a much improved Calculator class which can 
    handle parenthesis although the GUI does not allow for their input. The GUI is basic as hell but and I
    want to work on other things so it can wait. The Calculator class works just fine though.
    

Fractionator.Fraction(frac,unit=0) calculator class object.
    'frac' takes a tuple argument (num,denom). 
    My debugged and upgraded version of the example class given in MIT's lecture on OOP published on youtube. 
    I added multiplication and division as well as ironing out the bugs in the other functions.
