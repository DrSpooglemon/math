# math

Fractionator.Fraction(frac,unit=0) calculator class object.
  'frac' takes a tuple argument (num,denom). 
  My debugged and upgraded version of the example class given in MIT's lecture on OOP published on youtube. 
  I added multiplication and division as well as ironing out the bugs in the other functions.
